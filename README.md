## Privacy Policy

Five Prayers Android project aims to provide a private, anonymous and ads free experience for all users.Therefore, the app does not collect any data without your consent.
We process and store data based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU).

The following section fulfills the requirements of the GDPR Articles 13 and 14, and informs you about the collection and processing of personal data within our project.

#### Bug report tracking system

To help Five Prayers Android's improving and fixing bugs, we implemented a bug reporting system to allow user to send a crash report :  When Five Prayers Android crashes on a device, the user is shown a dialog containing a summary of the information about the bug. The user can opt to send the full details to us. When a user clicks the send button, Five Prayers Android composes an e-mail via the Android system containing the details in a machine-readable format called JSON. JSON is a text-based format, allowing users to read the data and check exactly what data could be sent to us. Users can remove or anonymize data which they do not want to be shared.

The JSON part contains the following information:

   - the e-mail address of the sender
   - the type/name of the error
   - the system language
   - time of the incident
   - version of the application
   - operating system name, version and API level
   - the error protocol (stacktrace)
   - user comment

Our bug reporting code is implemented to not embed any personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that there won't be any personal data contained by accident. Also, we cannot control whether the user will add any personal data to the generated JSON, nor can we control whether users add personal data outside it. Therefore we tried to implement our bug report system as transparently as possible, allowing the user to entirely control what data is sent. We assume that by sending an actual e-mail to the crash reporting system's address, any personal data is sent on behalf and with consent of the user. The e-mails are stored on a Google mail server, and won't be deleted before bug analysing takes place.
Any additional text in the e-mail that is not part of the JSON section is considered a user comment and will be processed and stored by us as well.

Only a small circle of people has access to the bug repport email. We instruct every user to delete any report which contains personal data as soon as it is discovered. We ask you to ensure you don't send us any personal data you don't want to share with us. We consider any content in the e-mails to be sent with your consent. You may, at any time, request deletion of the data. Please see below for your rights as a user.

#### Users' rights

   - Every user has the right to request details about the personal data stored about them according to GDPR Art. 15.
   - Every user has the right to request the correction or completion (GDPR Art. 16) or deletion (GDPR Art. 17) or restriction of use (GDPR Art. 18) of the data sent to us at any time.
   - According to GDPR Art. 77, you may, at any time, file a complaint about our data processing at your local data protection officer.
   - According to GDPR Art. 7 paragraph 3, you may revoke any consent you gave us about storing and processing data at any time for future time.
   - According to GDPR Art. 21, you may at any time dissent the processing and storing of data listed in the article.
