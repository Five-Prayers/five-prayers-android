## What Personal Information We Collect

### Location information

When you use the App, we need to know where you are, i.e., your geolocation information - latitude, longitude and altitude as communicated by your device - or the city that you have manually selected. This is important to us to calculate prayer timing.

The App request your location in the background even if the user interface is not opened. This is how we schedule prayer notifications and alarms.

The location information will be stored in your device and will NEVER BE TRANSMITTED.

### Bug report tracking system

To help Five Prayers Android's improving and fixing bugs, we implemented a bug reporting system to allow user to send a crash report : When Five Prayers Android crashes on a device, the user is shown a dialog containing a summary of the information about the bug. The user can opt to send the full details to us. When a user clicks the send button, Five Prayers Android composes an e-mail via the Android system containing the details in a machine-readable format called JSON. JSON is a text-based format, allowing users to read the data and check exactly what data could be sent to us. Users can remove or anonymize data which they do not want to be shared.

The JSON part contains the following information:

- the e-mail address of the sender
- the type/name of the error
- the system language
- time of the incident
- version of the application
- operating system name, version and API level
- the error protocol (stacktrace)
- user comment

Our bug reporting code is implemented to not embed any personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that there won't be any personal data contained by accident. Also, we cannot control whether the user will add any personal data to the generated JSON, nor can we control whether users add personal data outside it. Therefore we tried to implement our bug report system as transparently as possible, allowing the user to entirely control what data is sent. We assume that by sending an actual e-mail to the crash reporting system's address, any personal data is sent on behalf and with consent of the user. The e-mails are stored on a Google mail server, and won't be deleted before bug analysing takes place. Any additional text in the e-mail that is not part of the JSON section is considered a user comment and will be processed and stored by us as well.

### Sensitive personal information

You are informed that considering the religious nature of the App, we DONT COLLECT any personal information concerning you.

### Who your information may be shared to?

Your information is NEVER shared with a third party.

### How long do we store your information? 

The bug report e-mails are stored on a Google mail server, and won't be deleted before bug analysing takes place. By default, emails are deleted after 13 month.
